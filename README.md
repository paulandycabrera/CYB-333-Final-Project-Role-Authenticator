# CYB 333-Final Project-Role Authenticator
# Introduction:
When I first started learning about cyber security RBAC (role-based access control) piqued my interest. I personally consider it as one of the avenues where organizations can continuously improve on in regards with cyber security.
# Goal:
This CYB 333 projectâ€™s goal is to provide a simple tool to verify the role of each user logged in a terminal using Python. This authentication process mitigates users having unnecessary access to programs, tools and ultimately information that does not meet their authorization levels.
# Before Running:
Ensure the ```psutil``` library is installed:

    pip install psutil
